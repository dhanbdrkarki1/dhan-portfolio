# Static Assets

Place your static files in this directory:

- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon
- `logo.svg` - Your logo (if using)
- `resume.pdf` - Your resume for download
- `og-image.png` - Open Graph image for social sharing (1200x630px)
- `images/` - Folder for project screenshots, etc.

These files will be served from the root path (e.g., `/resume.pdf`).
